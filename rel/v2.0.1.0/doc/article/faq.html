				<h1>Q &amp; A (FAQ)</h1>

<h3><strong>Could you help me to integrate QuickIO.NET into my project(s)?</strong></h3>

<p>QuickIO.NET offers near the same signature of classes and methodes like the .NET System.IO namespace. It's very easy to integrate QuickIO.NET.
Please understand that I cannot offer assisted support. Contact a forum of your choice.</p>

<ul>
<li>For the German-speaking world I recommend <a href="www.mycsharp.de">myCsharp.de</a>.</li>
<li>For all English speaking I recommend <a href="www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> (use tag QuickIONET).</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Is this project for sale?</strong></h3>

<p>No.</p>

<h3><strong>Are there any code examples?</strong></h3>

<p>Yes. QuickIO.NET is well documentated.
Please check the code documentation of the specified class or method. Most of them are attended by samples.
Or check  http://quickio.net/Examples</p>

<h3><strong>Why QuickIO.NET was created</strong></h3>

<p>I was asked by some, why I've developed such a "brilliant" library.</p>

<p>First of all, thank you to everyone who trust QuickIO.NET.
I have about five years experimented with file operations in my free time and programmed some methods into a small library.
After a family bereavement in early 2014 (R.I.P. Max), I need to distract me and developed from the bottom up QuickIO.NET.</p>

<p>That's the reason why QuickIO.NET was created.</p>

<h3><strong>Will Mono be supported?</strong></h3>

<p>I am a software developer with focused on high-performance web applications in ASP.NET, cloud and Microsoft Azure.
I have no contact with Linux environments. Therefore, I have lost track of Mono support.
If someone agreed to integrate Mono support, so please get in touch with me.</p>

<h3><strong>Can I support you financially?</strong></h3>

<p>I reject financial support.
Instead please donate a small financial contribution to the <a href="http://www.tierheim-stuttgart.de/">animal shelter of Stuttgart/Germany</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>How is this documentation created?</strong></h3>

<p>Documentation is build with love and by <a href="http://sharpdox.de/">sharpDox</a></p>
