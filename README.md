## Project Description
QuickIO.NET is an extension for the .NET Framework to provide faster file operations.
To offer you a simple use and an easy integration QuickIO.NET methods lean against the ones provided by the .NET Framework.

## Main features
* **Much** faster browsing of folder structures (up to 30x faster)
* Lightning-fast retrieve of **metadata** of folders, files, and directory structures
* File chunk support for reading, comparisons and hashing.
* Data transfer services **monitored file and directory copy/move with progress events**
* Custom service and job support (via extensions and own implementation)
* **Long path support** (UNC paths) up to 32767 characters
* Calculate **checksums of files and file chunks**
* Fully tested source code using UnitTests
* Nearly identical signature of methods. So a simple replacement is possible
* **Async** Operations (requires .NET 4.0)
* Multiple releases from .NET 2.0 to .NET 4.5
